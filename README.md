# 3dPython

TODO:

  implement new way to create / draw quads.
  
  probably stop using python for this (as python is slower)

  new defs():
  
    # create quad in location with size and rotation
    def Quad(x,y,w,h,rx,ry):
    
    # create 2 points which define a quad (is not accurate, since quad CAN swivel around those 2 points)
    def Quad(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2):
    
    
    
    # probably the approach to use: create a plane as defined by a vector
    def Plane()

desc:

A small 3d concept written in Python, not like minecraft, but this has Quads which can have *almost* any rotation and size

To run, just download the 1.1 folder or ALL of its contents to a directory, then run the "simple-draw-attempt.py" 
preferably with python IDLE. 

When in game,  use w/a/s/d and shift+space to move.

You will spawn in the box, but just back up with "s" before moving your mouse.

There are bugs, but this is 3d in python, so not much is expected...
