# 3dPython

**Overview**

  3d engine baseline written in Python. Can draw triangles and triangles only (all other shapes are garbage). 
  
  Physics in works
  
  I say *baseline* because I plan for a possible C++ implementation

    Open the main.py

    w/a/s/d : directional movement

    space/shift : ascend/descend

    mouse : look around

    f : focus/unfocus

    esc / top-right X : exit



**ToDo:**
  
  Textures? (will be laggy)
  
  ~depth buffer?~
  
  Dynamic physics. (jumping, functional collision)
  
  Fix perspective near screen border.

  Fix spontaneous freezes.
  
  Implement LUT for faster maths.
  
  *More colors*

**Patched**

  Verts no longer clip when out of view.
  
  No more divide by 0 errors.
